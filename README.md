SVM classifier on a water potability dataset
The aim was to tune the binary classifier to achieve optimal accuracy in predicting the potability of drinking water.  I used the publicly available Kaggle data source "Drinking_Water_Potability"

Regarding the expected performance of the classifier, we can make some observations from the histograms. There are no features that have distinct differences in distributions between two classes. Generally, the distributions are very similar, and it will be difficult for the classifier to predict correctly. All attributes have big areas of overlap between the two classes.
Therefore, by examining the histograms, we can gain insight into the difficulty of the classification task and cannot tell the importance of a particular attribute in predicting the target variable.
